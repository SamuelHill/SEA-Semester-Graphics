#Notes on views:

##50 meters Surface Window:

- Station 244 has high reflection from the top of seamount and should be omitted (50m)
	- Quality flag? *check*
- Question: Does the area of high flow in the south west corner seem to be coming from upwelling of strong current through the 'channel' between parts of the mount? Or is that just part of a stronger system (see south east corner)? Or, is this from current around the western side of the mount.

##100 meters Surface Window:

- Selection criteria range for 100 meters is 0-500 mm/s for magnitude
- What is going on in the western side? Why is there a direction change going towards winslow... What is happening in this layer - Is it the 'tongue' of salinity?

##150 meters Surface Window:

- Station 245 and 246 have high reflection from the top of seamount and should be omitted? (150m)
	- Quality flag?
- I have drawn channels in here in one view, and added depths in another.
	- How do you add arrow heads to the flow lines? What is the best way to show depths (currently my labels come from a "depth-finder" script)?

##200 meters Surface Window:

- Selection criteria range for 100 meters is 0-300 mm/s for magnitude
- There is still some reflection around the seamount it seems...
- Why the currents to the east going a different dirrection?

##Comments on Surface Windows:

- Should I look at the depths of channels between parts of mounts? (more, how should I)
- What are the dominant current patterns that this is interrupting? It seems that the dominant current changes from East/West in upper water column to North/South in lower... Any reasons?
	- Trade winds push water along the equator and ekman effect push water north and south respectively. This creates upwelling at the equator that comes down on the surface. The subtropical gyre creates downwelling that results in a 'disk' of salinity that extends north into PIPA.
- Should I cut off all data points at the top of reef that are below the depth of the reef top?
- Can I/how can I comment on how the southern side seems to have stronger currents due to channels (what is the name of this effect?) and deflection around mounts? 
	- Venturi
- Why do the depth labels not show up in the gifs? Why do the grid lines not show up in the gifs?
	- Try postscript/restart ODV...
