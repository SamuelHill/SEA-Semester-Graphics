# SEA-Semester-Graphics

This repository contains two projects that both work on visualizing and analyzing the data collected during SEA Semester class S-261's voyage over and around Winslow Reef as a part of the Directed Oceanographic Research project on seamounts that I had proposed.

The python code such as adcp, ctd_HC, etopo, and depth_sounder helped to process the data and display various graphics for analysis and sanity checking. All of the python code (in this main directory as well as in data and test_code) was written by me aboard the Robert C. Seamans, again as part of the voyage of class S-261 through PIPA. In addition to the python code, Ocean Data View (ODV) was used to help analyze specific tracks and produce many of the 2D graphics found in the [final report](./seamount_effect.pdf). The analysis of processed data and graphic visualizations, as well as the writing of this report was assisted by my group-mates Nathan Kemp, Karl Kiser, Emily Sage Landers, and Christina Quinn.

The javascript in the js directory and the graphics_final.html associated with it are from the final project for CSC-344 Computer Graphics and Image Processing at Furman University with the assistance of my group-mates Tyler Conn, Patrick Musau, and Sean Pryhoda. The visualization created in three.js helped to solve a problem I had experienced at sea with creating a 3D graph of the adcp data.
